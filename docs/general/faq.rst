Why can I only submit my code for the Robot Playground project?
---------------------------------------------------------------

It is the only project that is currently available for submissions. The Tower of Hanoi
project can only be used for demo submissions. But we are planning to make further projects
available. One planned project is a path planning challenge where you need to navigate
an object through a maze.

Can I share video recordings and other data of my jobs on social media?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, please do! You can download job data directly from the website and upload
it to your favorite social media site like Twitter, Youtube or Facebook.
